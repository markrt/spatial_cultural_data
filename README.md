# Spatial cultural data

Repo where I collate datasets on cultural funding: Arts Council England spend, Cultural Recovery Fund, that sort of thing.

The idea is that this is part of a ~~~mysterious~~~ research project about these questions, but I might as well organise this data and associated code in public while I'm doing it.

Ordnance Survey shapefiles obviously not attached, but if you don't know where to find them via the OS let me know and I can point you in the right direction.
